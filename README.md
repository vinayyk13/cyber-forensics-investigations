# Cyber Forensics Investigations

## Overview
This repository contains digital forensic case studies and investigation write-ups developed through academic labs and simulated forensic scenarios. The focus is on analysing digital artefacts, interpreting evidence, and presenting findings in a structured and professional manner.

The work emphasises **forensic reasoning and evidence interpretation**, rather than tool output alone.
